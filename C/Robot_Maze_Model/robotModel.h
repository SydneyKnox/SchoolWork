 * Programmer: Mona K. Garvin
 * Name: robotModel.h
 * Description: This file contains a structure and associated function
 *              prototypes to model a robot. A RobotModel variable
 *              has members to model its current position (given by a row
 *              and column) and direction. The direction defines where
 *              the robot will move if the robot is to move straight ahead:
 *              0 = east or an increasing column direction,
 *              1 = north or a decreasing row direction
 *              2 = west or a decreasing column direction
 *              3 = south or an increasing row direction
 *              Functions are also provided to modify the current position and
 *              direction of a given robot to move one unit straight, move one
 *              unit to the left, move one unit to the right, and make a u-turn.

 * Output: robot = RobotModel * = pointer to modified RobotModel structure
